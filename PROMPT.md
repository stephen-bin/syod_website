# PROMPT: "The Spiritual Youth" Website Generation

**Goal**: Build a high-performance landing page for the book *The Spiritual Youth on a Date* by Stephen Npoandan Binaansim.

## 1. Brand Strategy: "The Modern Apostle"

We are pivoting away from "cozy/rustic" marriage tropes. The target audience is **Gen Z & Millennial Youth (13-35)**.

* **Vibe**: **Intellectual Fire**. Faith meets Reason. Urgent, authentic, and mission-focused.
* **Key Message**: "The world says date for fun. God says date for a future."
* **Voice**: Direct, scriptural, logical, and uncompromising.

## 2. Design System

* **Palette**:
  * **Primary Accent**: `#E01919` (Bold Red) - Used for Buttons, Key Highlights, Borders.
  * **Background**: `#FFFFFF` (Stark White) - Clean, minimalist canvas.
  * **Text**: `#0A0A0A` (Deep Black) - High contrast, serious.
  * **Secondary**: `#F8F9FA` (Light Grey) and `#222` (Dark Grey for video section).
* **Typography**:
  * **Headers**: *Oswald* (Google Font) - Condensed, Bold, Uppercase. High impact.
  * **Body**: *Poppins* (Google Font) - Clean, geometric, readable.

## 3. Section Requirements

### Hero Section

* **Visual**: Split layout. Left: Large 3D floating book cover. Right: Copy.
* **Headline**: "DON'T JUST DATE. DATE WITH PURPOSE."
* **Subhead**: "A letter on relationships to every young adult."
* **CTA**: Red Button "ORDER NOW".

### The Agitation (Problem)

* **Headline**: "THE WORLD SAYS DATE FOR FUN. GOD SAYS DATE FOR A FUTURE."
* **Content**: 3 Cards (Confusion, Compromise, Clarity).
* **Style**: Clean cards with Red top-borders and FontAwesome icons.

### The Author

* **Headline**: "MATHEMATICIAN. MINISTER. MENTOR."
* **Bio**: Highlight Stephen's background in AI/Math to establish "Logical Faith."

### Youth Engagement (The "Vibe")

* **Style**: Dark mode section (`bg-black`).
* **Content**: Grid of vertical video placeholders ("TikTok style").
* **Headlines**: "Is it sin to kiss?", "Talking vs Dating?", "How to break up?".

### Footer

* **CTA**: "Your Future Marriage Starts Now."
* **Buttons**: "Order on Amazon" and "Bulk Order (Churches)".

## 4. Technical Constraints

* **Stack**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (No heavy frameworks like React/Vue).
* **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first architecture. Video grid must stack on mobile.
* **Animations**: CSS3 Keyframes (`fade-in-up`, `float`) and IntersectionObserver for scroll reveal.
